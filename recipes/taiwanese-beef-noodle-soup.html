    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil enough water in a pot to boil all of the beef. Once the water is boiling, add the beef. Let it come up to a boil, 
            and boil for 1 minute. Strain in a colander and rinse the beef thoroughly with fresh water to remove any impurities.
        </li>
        <li>
            In your instant pot, turn on the saute setting. Add the oil, crushed ginger, garlic, scallions, and onions. 
            Stir to lightly caramelize until the onion turns translucent. Add the tomato and dried chilies.
        </li>
        <li>Add the meat to the pot. Add the tomato paste, spicy bean paste, sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine.
            Mix thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 8 cups of water into the instant pot. Add the spice packet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Close the lid of the instant pot ensuring that the vent is set to sealed. Cook for 100 minutes on the Meat/Stew setting.
            If you don't have an instant pot, cook the soup on a low simmer for 3-4 hours
        </li>
        <li>
            When the instant pot timer is up, carefully release the pressure valve. Boil some noodles per the instructions on the packaging,
            and in the last minute or two of the noodles cooking, throw in and blanch the bok choy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve each bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a serving of noodles, a few stalks of bok choy and top with the cilantro, 
            scallions, and Chinese pickled mustard.
        </li>
    </ol>

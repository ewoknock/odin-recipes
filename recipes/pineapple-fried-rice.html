        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine curry powder, white pepper, sugar, and salt. Stir to break up the curry powder and mix well.</li>
            <li>Combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, and shrimp paste in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>In a wok or large frying pan, heat up 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat until hot. Sear the shrimp without stirring
                until they are at least halfway done and slightly browned on the underside. Flip and cook the other side until just done.
                Turn off the heat and remove the shrimp from the pan keeping the oil in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Add more oil to the wok if needed, then add the eggs and scramble slightly.
                When the egg is halfway cooked, add the rice and onions. Toss to mix.
            </li>
            <li>Add the dry seasoning and the sauce. Toss until the rice grains are evenly coated in the seasoning and sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss in the pineapple and raisins. Then allow the rice to sit for 10-15 seconds to toast and brown slightly.
                Toss everything and repeat the toasting process a few times.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off the heat and stir in the cashews, tomatoes, and green onions. Serve on a plate and add a garnish of cucumber slices
                and/or shredded coconut if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
